# covid-visualisation
This project was part of my Masters Thesis, for a Data Visualisation module. 

The data used is from the Johns Hopkins University, which on 10th March 2023 ceased collecting and reporting Covid-19 data. 

The code will create a Dash application on the localhost "Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/"
