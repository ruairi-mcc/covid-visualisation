# covid-visualisation
This project was part of my Masters Thesis, for a Data Visualisation module. 

The data used is from the Johns Hopkins University, which on 10th March 2023 ceased collecting and reporting Covid-19 data. 

The code will create a Dash application on the localhost "8050"

You can then view the individual stats for any chosen country.

Given that the Johns Hopkins data is no longer being updated it will affect the rolling stats.
